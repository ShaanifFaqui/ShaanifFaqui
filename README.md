## 😴 About Me
Hey, I'm **Shaanif Ahmed**, just a simple coder who's probably debugging while you're reading this. I build stuff when I'm not scrolling memes, watching anime, or finding new ways to procrastinate. I'm into tech, automation, gaming, and making jokes about my own code. My life goal? Write code that doesn't make future me question my life choices. I'm basically just a funny developer who likes to roast himself. 😄

- 😴 **Currently:** Actually working on something (shocking, I know)
- 🧠 **Learning:** New ways to break my code in creative ways
- 💤 **Mission:** Write code that doesn't make me facepalm later
- 🤡 **Fun Fact:** I once spent 2 hours debugging a missing semicolon (true story, I'm not proud)
- 🎭 **Special Skill:** Making terrible code look intentional
- 🕐 **Best Coding Time:** When I should be sleeping (classic developer move)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

  <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=python,django,java,c,html,css,js,git,linux,docker,php,mysql,github&theme=dark" alt="Tech Stack Icons" />
</div>

- **Secret Weapon:** Stack Overflow and a lot of trial and error 🙏
- **Allergic To:** Documentation and meetings that could've been emails 🌅
- **Coding Philosophy:** "If it works, don't touch it" 🤷‍♂️
- **Debugging Method:** Console.log everything, then forget to remove them

## 😂 Fun Zone (Where I'm Actually Awake)
- **🎮 Current Project:** Something that will probably break in production
- **😴 Sleep Schedule:** What's that? (I'm a developer, remember?)
- **🦆 Rubber Duck Therapy:** <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7aCUz8jF2h52y7Vm/giphy.gif" width="40" alt="Rubber Duck"> My duck's heard all my code rants (it's seen things)
- **📅 Deployment Strategy:** "It works on my machine" (famous last words)
- **🎯 Current Goal:** Write code that doesn't make me question my career choices
- **🤖 AI Assistant:** "Hey Google, why is my code not working?" (daily ritual)
- **🎬 Anime Status:** Currently watching something that's probably affecting my sleep schedule
- **🎮 Gaming Status:** "Just one more game" (said 5 hours ago)

---

## 🛌 Learning & Chaos (Mostly Chaos)
- 🎮 **Code Game:** Write one function, spend 3 hours debugging it
- 🕹️ **Challenge:** Fork this README, add something funny, and tag me. I'll probably merge it... eventually
- 📚 **Learning (When I'm Not Breaking Things):**
  - JavaScript (still learning, still confused)
  - Python (it's supposed to be easy, right?)
  - CSS (why does centering a div require a PhD?)
  - React (because everyone else is doing it)
- 🍿 **Best Coding Snack:** Whatever's within arm's reach
- 🏓 **Ping Me For:** Code help, memes, anime recommendations, or "why is this not working?" rants
- 🎪 **Special Talent:** Making simple bugs look like complex problems
- 🎬 **Anime Recommendations:** Always happy to share (even if you didn't ask)
- 🎮 **Gaming Sessions:** "I'll just play for 30 minutes" (turns into 4 hours)

## 🏆 Achievements (I'm Kinda Proud)
- 🏅 Survived a regex disaster (and lived to tell the tale)
- 🔍 Fixed a bug by googling for 2 hours (Stack Overflow is my hero)
- 😴 Successfully avoided meetings for weeks (it's an art form)
- 💻 Master of "It works on my machine" excuses
- 🌍 Wrote a "Hello World" that actually worked (once)
- 🎯 Successfully deployed something without breaking production (miracle)
- 🧠 Know enough to be dangerous (but not enough to be useful)
- 🎪 Made a calculator that works (most of the time)
- 🎬 Watched an entire anime season in one sitting (no regrets)
- 🎮 Beat a boss after 47 attempts (persistence is key)
